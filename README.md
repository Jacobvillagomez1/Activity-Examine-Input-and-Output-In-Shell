<p>
First you need to click the command line and type echo hello and press enter. The echo command outputs a specified string of text (You should get the hello sent back to you)
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
This time we are going to use echo hello again, but include quotation marks around the string data. Type echo "hello" into the shell and press ENTER (You should get the hello sent back to you)
</p>

</p>
<p>
Next Use the echo command to output your name to the shell. Type echo "name" into the shell if you want you can replace "name" with your own name, and press ENTER. (For the example above I put "name")
</p>

</p>
<p>
Next we are going to use subtraction in the command line by typing expr 32 - 8. The expr command performs basic mathematical calculations and can be useful when you need to quickly perform a calculation. (You should get 24 back)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Next we are going to use multiplication in the command line by typing expr 3500 * 12. The expr command can also perform multiplication calculations. (You should get 42000 back)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
In this final task, youâ€™ll use the clear command to clear the Bash shell of all existing output. This allows you to start with the cursor at the top of the Bash shell window.
